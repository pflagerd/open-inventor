Open Inventor
=============

Open Inventor is an object oriented scene graph library implemented in C++
layered on top of OpenGL. It was originally developed by
[SGI](http://www.sgi.com/).

This Repository
===============

This repository is a fork of the original one which was put on github here: https://github.com/aumuell/open-inventor.

The initial work here is being done on Ubuntu 17.10 using eclipse oxygen for C/C++.  Hence the .project and .cproject files.

There is a directory called `LabBook` in which work progress is summarized and tracked.



# 1st Goal

The first goal of this project is to get the current gnu-make build working in both release and debug modes, and to correct any misinformation in the makefiles or other documentation.
